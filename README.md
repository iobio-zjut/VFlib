## INSTALLATION

- Python > 3.5

- PSIPRED (it's used to predict the secondary structure of the target sequence) (Online server link: http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) (Download link: http://bioinfadmin.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/psipred/)

- trRosetta(it's used to predict the distance profile of the target sequence) (Online server link: https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/)

- HHsuite(it's used to generate the HMM-profile of query sequence and obtain candidate fragments) (Download link:https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite)

  

## RUNNING

```
# VFlib.py

# arguments:
#    input		Paths of various input files, including sequence file, hhr file, ss2 file,pdb file, and pdb angle file.
#    output		Path of output result.

"""
optional arguments:
	-seq_path	The path of the query sequence.
	-hhr_path	The path of the hhr file generated by hhsearch in accordance with the HMM-profiles of the variable segments.
	-ss2_path	The path of the predicted ss2 file of the target sequence.
	-pdbt_path	The path of the pdb files in master database.
	-angle_path The path of pdb angle file in master database. 
"""
```

1. Predicting

```

     python VFlib.py

```

2. Chopping the HMM-profile of the query sequence  into a nested set of segments.

   python divided_hhm.py

3. Obtaining the hhr file

   ./hhm_hhr.sh
